<h2>Help for the Donor Manager Program</h2>

<h3>Author: Peter Rice, copyright 2018</h3>

<b>Purpose</b><br><br>
	This program exists to support organizations which raise money from 
	individuals and groups through personal contact. We understand their 
	need to<br>
<ol>
<li>Maintain a list of names, contact information, donation history, pledge 
records (if this applies) and other information which is useful in the 
business of encouraging donations.</li>
<li>Edit this data using whatever device is at hand (computer, tablet or 
smart phone) and from anywhere they might be.</li>
<li>Produce reports from the data which shows lists of contacts determined 
by geographic area, date of last donation, total annual donation, etc. 
As well, if information is entered here which is needed for maintaining 
the financial data of the organization, it should be available in a format 
which can easily be incorporated in the software used for keeping books.</li>
<li>The program should also make it easy to send messages to one or many 
people for whom contact data exists.</li>
</ol>

<p>This program does not assist in the production of solicitation products, 
(outside of messages sent through email or text messaging), production of 
web pages or the delivery and collection of electronic data on current or 
potential donors.</p>

<p>This program does not maintain or produce any financial data outside of 
lists of donations received. However, these lists can be exported to *.csv 
files, which can be imported into commonly used financial software.</p>

<b>Philosophy</b>
	<p>A Donor is a person or entity (typically represented by a person) 
	with direct contact data. The Donors page has fields for the entry 
	of name, address, city, state, zip,  country, telephone number and 
	email address of a donor. There is also a Notes field for any other 
	data which might be good to have. In theory, a report can be generated 
	which refers to one or more of these fields for selection purposes. 
	For example, a report on all donors with a given zip code, or all who 
	live in a given state but do not have a specific zip code.</p>
	<p>Once the data for a donor (actual or anticipated) is entered, we assume 
	that it is not desirable to delete that data. One never knows when a 
	contact once made might have a positive result. It is, however, possible 
	to Hide a donor's data. There is a separate screen for examining the 
	hidden donors, and from there either un-hiding or deleting them.</p>
	<p>In addition to informa	tion on donations, there is a separate record 
	for information on pledges. The program does not make assumptions on 
	the exact nature of a pledge beyond recording that one exists, has a 
	beginning and ending date and involves some stated amount (whether a 
	total or a monthly amount is not important) and a description of some 
	sort. The user will have to keep up with the progress of donations 
	against the pledge and record when, if ever, it is completed or abandoned.</p>

<h3>Screen by screen help:</h3>

<b>Login:</b> this screen appears at initial entry to the web site, and the user 
is required to enter a valid userid and password. If you expect to know 
how to do this, but do not, please contact the person who is responsible 
for enrolling users. If incorrecct data is entered, you will be returned 
to this screen and a message will tell you that you have failed to enter 
valid values.<br><br>

It is also possible to return to this screen if you decide to log out of 
the program or if some other problem requires that you log in again.<br><br>

A successful entry of valid data will take you to the Donors screen.<br><br>

<b>Donors:</b> The title of the screen is "View and Edit Donor 
Information. If the name in the Name field is 
“New Donor” when you enter the screen, 
you are being invited to enter data for a new donor. If you 
come to this screen by selecting “Donors” from the menu in any screen, 
you might see actual donor data. In this case, you are being invited to 
edit the data. After making appropriate entries, you may save, and get 
the “New Donor” setup. If you wish to enter a new donor but there is 
already data for an existing donor showing, select the “New Donor” button 
on the right. If your reason for being here is to work on donations by a 
specific donor, you may press the name of that person in the list to the 
right to load their data, then press the “Donations for this Donor” button 
to go to the screen where that information is entered or edited.<br><br>

In addition, the menu across the top invites you to enter the “Emails” 
screen, the “Reports” screen, the “Manage Hidden Donors” screen or to 
“Logout”. If you are an “admin” user, you may also select to enter the 
“Admin” screen.<br><br>

<b>Manage Hidden Donors:</b> If there are no hidden donors, this page only shows 
a message to that effect. If the there are any, there is a list showing 
the id, name and two check boxes, one for “un hide” and one for “delete”. 
Un-hide means that the hidden donor is no longer hidden (it disappears 
from the list) and can be edited back in the Donor screen. Delete means 
just that – it is gone.<br><br>

Hiding donors can make working with the Donors list easier because inactive donors 
do not appear, and the list is shorter. But a donor can quickly become active, 
so allowing them to become un-hidden means all of the data about them is 
available again.<br><br>

<b>Emails:</b> From here you can select a donor, add a From address, a BCC address, 
a subject and the text of a message, and send it. If it was successfully 
sent, a message will appear in a separate tab on your browser, showing the 
details. If you put your own address in BCC, a copy will be sent to that address. 
A failure will be announced in a separate browser tab.<br><br>

We plan to add a feature to select a set of recipients and send an email to 
each one--not one email with multiple recipients, but one single email to 
each recipient. <br><br>

<b>Reports:</b> Each line in the list of available reports represents one way to 
view donations – by date range, including all donations or just the donations 
for one donor. That last report may be copied and pasted into an email or 
a letter as a report to a donor on their gifts for a year.<br><br>

<b>Admin:</b> This screen is available to logins which are certified as “admin”. 
The purpose of this is to allow multiple people to view and work on the 
donor list and the donations, but to limit the ability to add other users 
or to make essential changes to the system to people who are selected for 
that chore.<br><br>

On the screen is the panel which allows the user to add a new user, remove 
a user or change the password of a user. It is not possible to have two 
users with the same userid!<br><br>

The other panel on this screen contains the information required to send 
an email. This includes the url of the mail system host, the userid 
(mail address) and password of the mail user. The port value is whatever 
the mail host requires. All of this information is 
available from the mail host prganization.<br><br>
